# Classification-of-Morphologies-of-Galaxies

â€¢ In this project, We did a comparative study across models using HOG, LBP, Image moments based features as well as CNN architectures to classify properties of galaxies with a degree of probability close to the annotation done by volunteers as part of a classification project.
